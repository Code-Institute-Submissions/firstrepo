# Smitech Engineering (Terminal 4) Landing Page

This project is a landing page for potential hires or interested parties to visit and know more about my company and what we do.

It gives a brief summary of the company and the team at Changi Airport Terminal 4, its individual departments and their respective scope of works. It serves as a quick information hub for the user.
Through this website, users would be able to gain an insight into the team dynamics and types of activities and allow interested persons or potential hires to have a good idea of the work-life as a future employee.

## UX - How the website looks

White fonts were selected for contrast on a blue/dark blue gradient background, while a greenish font was used for a white background. Blue and green are corporate colours, chosen to be in line with the corporate identity as the website shall be representing our company and its interests.

Text is kept minimal, while image carousels are used as visual information for quick viewing. This is to allow readers a more lucid understanding of the content, which is more effective than text alone.

Sections are in alternate white/dark blue background as clear demarcations of the different sections.

## UI - User's interaction with the website


The website is intended to allow users to glance through the information and digest quickly without having to spend too much time reading. As such, the user only needs to scroll vertically through different sections. If the user is interested to know more, horizontally scrolling carousel images are available for them.

The navigation bar is also available for the user to skip directly to each section; this allows a quick and seamless transition to obtain the required information by the user.

## Features - Things for the user to interact with
**Existing features:**
1. A navigation bar is placed at the top for the user to navigate to each section quickly. The navigation bar collapses into a toggle for smaller screen sizes.

2. A contact form is included at the bottom of the page to allow readers to reach out to the company for more information. 
An address is also included in the footer if the user wishes to visit the location.

**Features to Implement:**
1. An interactive chatbot to answer common enquiries such as contact or location information.
2. Additional pages that are accessible as links from each section for details and information.
